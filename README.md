# Developer Portfolio built with Next.js and Cosmic

![Screenshot of the Cosmic Developer Porfolio application template](/public/images/dev-portfolio.png)

To build this app, weâ€™re going to use the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) - A React framework for production that makes it easy to spin up a full-stack application.
- [Cosmic](https://www.cosmicjs.com/) - A Headless CMS enables the independence of the data (content) layer and gives us the ability to quickly manage template content.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A performant utility-first CSS framework that can be composed directly in your markup.

## Getting started

### Environment Variables

You'll need to create an .env file in the root of the project. Log in to Cosmic and from Bucket Settings > API Access take the following values:

```
//.env
COSMIC_BUCKET_SLUG=your_cosmic_slug
COSMIC_READ_KEY=your_cosmic_read_key
COSMIC_PREVIEW_SECRET=your_preview_secret
```

Install the dependencies by running one of the following commands:

```
pnpm install
# or
yarn
# or
npm install
```

Then run the development server:

```
pnpm dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Previewing Unpublished Content

This template supports [Next.js Draft Mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/draft-mode), allowing you to preview unpublished blog posts and works pages from the Cosmic dashboard.

### Setup in the codebase

To enable preview mode, you'll need to set the `COSMIC_PREVIEW_SECRET` environment variable in your `.env` file. This secret can be any random string, though we recommend creating a secure string for security reasons.

### Setup in Cosmic

\*Note that this template currently supports Draft Mode for **Posts** and **Works** Object types.

In your Cosmic dashboard, go to your **Content** and select **Posts** or **Works** from the list of Object types. Next, select **Object type settings > Additional settings**.

Start by copying and pasting this URL into the **Preview link** field:

`https://YOUR_LOCAL_OR_PROD_HOST/api/draft?secret=YOUR_SECRET_PREVIEW_KEY&path=OBJECT_TYPE_PATH&slug=[object_slug]`

Replace `YOUR_LOCAL_OR_PROD_HOST` with your local host (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`) or production host (e.g. `https://your-app.vercel.app`), and replace `YOUR_SECRET_PREVIEW_KEY` with the secret you set in your `.env` file. Match the `OBJECT_TYPE_PATH` to the Object type you're editing (e.g. `posts` or `works`).

From here, you can now preview unpublished content from the Cosmic dashboard by clicking the **Preview** button in the righthand sidebar when editing an individual Object.
